# CryptoSuggester Backend 

This is the Backend for my CrypoSuggester project. This is my first Springboot project where I get data about Bitcoin and Ethereum from two api's. I made this project for an interview assignment for Chainalysis. 

## What I learned
* A good understanding about Springboot
* Fetching data from an API

## Usage
Open file on an IDE and run.\
\
Go to this link for data on Bitcoin and Ethereum from Coingecko:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/exchangeAData
```
Go to this link for data on Bitcoin Coinpaprika:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/exchangeBbitcoin
```
Go to this link for data on Ethereum Coinpaprika:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/exchangeBethereum
```
